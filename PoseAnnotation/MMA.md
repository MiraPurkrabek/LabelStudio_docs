# MMA Annotation Guidelines

This task focuses on identifying instances of close physical contact. We've chosen MMA matches as they closely represent our area of interest.

The task comprises two main parts:

1. Selecting appropriate images and figures.
2. Annotating poses with extended visibility.

Detailed instructions for each part are provided below.

## Selecting Images and Figures

Your primary goal is to select relevant images from MMA match videos, discarding the rest. These videos have been broken down into frames (typically one frame every 2 seconds, or 0.5 fps). Your task is to pick the right frames.

A suitable frame is any frame that depicts one or more of the following situations:

- Two fighters in close contact.
- Two fighters in a position where they overlap in the frame.
- Fighters partially hidden by the referee or elements of the ring.
  - frames where the referee is too close to the camera are not suitable.

Please avoid selecting frames with:
- Spectators
- Non-match scenes, such as advertisements, pre-fight staredowns, winner announcements, etc.
- Scenes where fighters and referees are distant and easily distinguishable.

If a frame is relevant, annotate it by drawing bounding boxes around all individuals in the ring, which typically include fighters and a referee, but occasionally may also feature a medic or coach.

Refer to the provided files for examples: LINK contains correct scenes with annotations, while LINK displays scenes that should not be annotated.
