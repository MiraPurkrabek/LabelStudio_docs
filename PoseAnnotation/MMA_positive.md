# Example images with annotations

Here are published the example images of correct annotations of MMA matches.

## Bounding boxes

Two fighters close to each other. If the refree is visible, annotate him too.

<p float="middle">
  <img src="images/MMA_box.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_box_with_refree.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_overlap_3.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_bjj_with_refree.png" width="300" />
</p>

Annotate even when the image is taken through the fence of the ring.

</p>

Annotate even when people are not close to each in reality other but they overlap in the picture (including the referee.)

<p float="middle">
  <img src="images/MMA_overlap.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_overlap_2.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_significant_occlusion.png" width="300" />
  <img src="images/MMA_significant_occlusion_02.png" width="300" />
</p>
